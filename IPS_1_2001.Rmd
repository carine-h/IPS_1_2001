# Question 1
##A)
The systematic component is: 
\begin{align*}
\mu_{i} = 2 + 10X_{i}
\end{align*}

The stochastic component is: 
\begin{align*}
\sigma^{2} = 9
\end{align*}

##B)
1,000 observations where 500 have $X_{i} = 1$ and 500 have $X_{i} = 0$
Find $Y_{i}$ and plot its distribution

```{r}
# instructions
  # simulate Yi for each person and plot distribution of Yi
  # describe plot 

```

```{r}
# 1. B EXAMPLE W20 OBS
x<- c(rep(0,10), rep(1, 10))  ## make 1000
mu <- 2 +10*x 
# sigma
rnorm(n= 20, mean = mu, sd = sqrt(9))# sd is quare root of variance

# make 1000 

# plot 



```
